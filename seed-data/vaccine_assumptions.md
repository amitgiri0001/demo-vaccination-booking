It take about 3 minutes to vaccinate a person.
Waiting time of 30 minutes is there after vaccination.

A slot (30 minutes) capacity in a center = number of staff available on the date and time selected 
                                                * 
                                            number of people can be vaccinated by one staff per 30 minutes

Assuming it takes about 3 minutes to vaccinate a person 
number of people can be vaccinated by one staff per 30 minutes = 30/3 = 10
